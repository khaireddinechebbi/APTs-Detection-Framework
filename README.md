# APT Detection Framework Project

## üìñ Overview

This project implements a comprehensive detection framework for identifying Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activities using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The system leverages Sigma rules, Elastic Stack (ELK), and simulated attack environments to detect sophisticated adversary behaviors.

## üéØ Objective

Build and test detection rules against advanced persistent threats by analyzing APT group TTPs, developing Sigma detection rules, and validating them in a controlled SIEM environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project utilizes a multi-component architecture with interconnected systems:

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Data Collection: Winlogbeat vs Filebeat
#### When to Use Which Beats

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start: What needs to be collected?] --> B{Is the source a<br>Windows Event Log?};

    B -- Yes --> C[Use Winlogbeat];
    C --> D[Best for:<br>- Security Events<br>- System Events<br>- Application Events<br>- PowerShell/Sysmon Logs];

    B -- No --> E{Is the source a<br>log file on any OS?};
    
    E -- Yes --> F[Use Filebeat];
    F --> G[Best for:<br>- Web Server Logs<br>- Custom App Logs<br>- Firewall/Proxy Logs<br>- Text-based logs];

    C --> H[Final Setup<br>for Comprehensive Monitoring];
    F --> H;

        J[Filebeat<br>Everything Else]
    end

    H --> K[Elasticsearch];
```

#### Functional Comparison

| Feature | Winlogbeat | Filebeat |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Specialized collector for Windows Event Logs | General-purpose collector for log files on any OS |
| **Data Source** | Windows Event Log channels (Security, System, Application, PowerShell, Sysmon) | Flat files (.log, .txt, .csv), stdin, TCP/UDP |
| **OS Compatibility** | Windows only | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD) |
| **Pre-built Content** | Yes. Comes with ECS fields, dashboards for Windows events | Yes, but generic. Modules for various services |
| **Ease of Use (Windows)** | Extremely Easy. Point-and-click event channel selection | More Manual. Requires file path specification |
| **Key Advantage** | Deep integration with Windows OS | Extreme flexibility for any file-based logs |

### SIEM Platform: ELK vs Splunk

| Feature | ELK Stack | Splunk |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | Open-source (Free) | Enterprise (Expensive) |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted | Self-hosted/SaaS |
| **Scalability** | High (with proper configuration) | Excellent |
| **Ease of Use** | Steeper learning curve | More user-friendly |
| **Customization** | Highly customizable | Less flexible |
| **Community** | Large open-source community | Enterprise support |

We selected ELK for this project due to its open-source nature, customization capabilities, and alignment with industry-standard detection engineering practices.
