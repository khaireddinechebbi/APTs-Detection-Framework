## Recommended Techniques for Project Expansion

Based on your current work and the threat landscape, here are the **top 5 techniques** I recommend adding to your project:

### 1. ðŸ”´ **T1546.003 - WMI Event Subscription** (APT29)
**Why:** This is a sophisticated persistence mechanism that APT29 heavily uses. It would complement your WMI (T1047) work perfectly.
**Use Case:** Advanced persistence that's hard to detect
**MITRE Tactics:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation

### 2. ðŸ”´ **T1558.003 - Kerberoasting** (APT29) 
**Why:** Critical credential access technique that's fundamental to APT29's lateral movement
**Use Case:** Domain privilege escalation and credential theft
**MITRE Tactics:** Credential Access

### 3. ðŸŸ  **T1001.002/T1027.003 - Steganography** (APT29)
**Why:** Advanced data obfuscation that would enhance your defense evasion coverage
**Use Case:** Data exfiltration and payload hiding
**MITRE Tactics:** Defense Evasion

### 4. ðŸŸ  **T1562.002 - Disable Windows Event Logging** (APT29)
**Why:** Directly impacts detection capabilities - crucial for understanding attacker tradecraft
**Use Case:** Defense evasion and operational security
**MITRE Tactics:** Defense Evasion

## Project Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Adds (1-2 weeks)
- **T1546.003 - WMI Event Subscription** - Builds on your existing WMI expertise
- **T1562.002 - Disable Event Logging** - Practical defense evasion technique

### Phase 2: Advanced Techniques (2-3 weeks)  
- **T1558.003 - Kerberoasting** - Critical credential access
- **T1001.002 - Steganography** - Advanced obfuscation

### Phase 3: Completion (1 week)
- **T1055.001 - Process Injection** - Finalize Lazarus coverage

## Why These Techniques?

1. **Strategic Coverage:** Covers both APT29 and Lazarus core techniques
2. **Progressive Difficulty:** Builds from your current knowledge
3. **High Impact:** Addresses critical attack vectors
4. **Detection Value:** Provides significant defensive insights
5. **Career Relevance:** These are in-demand skills for threat hunting.
