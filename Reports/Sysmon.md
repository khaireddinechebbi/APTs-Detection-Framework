Great question üëç
The **`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`** log channel records events generated by **Sysinternals Sysmon**, which extends Windows logging with detailed system monitoring.

Each **`event.code`** in Sysmon corresponds to a specific monitoring capability.
Here‚Äôs a full list of Sysmon event IDs (as of **Sysmon v15, 2025**):

‚úÖ **Total:** Currently **30 event codes**
üîß Not all are always enabled ‚Äì it depends on your **Sysmon config XML**.

Would you like me to also create a **visual mapping (like a cheat sheet)** that groups these events into **Process, File, Registry, Network, WMI, etc.** so you can use it directly for hunting/detection work?
