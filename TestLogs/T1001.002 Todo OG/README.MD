# Atomic Red Team Tests for APT29 - T1001.002 Data Obfuscation: Steganography

This repository documents **Atomic Red Team tests for T1001.002 (Data Obfuscation: Steganography)** that closely emulate the tradecraft of **APT29** (a.k.a. Cozy Bear, Midnight Blizzard) as demonstrated in **Operation Ghost**.

The goal is to:
* Provide defenders with relevant tests for detecting steganography activities
* Map the tests to known APT29 behaviors and campaigns
* Highlight specific techniques used by this threat group for covert communications and data exfiltration

---

## Background

* **APT29** (Cozy Bear, Midnight Blizzard) is a Russian state-sponsored threat group
  * Known for sophisticated cyber espionage and long-term campaigns
  * Highly skilled in advanced evasion techniques and covert communications
  * Uses **steganography** extensively for hiding C2 traffic and data exfiltration

* **Operation Ghost** (2013-2019) was a sophisticated APT29 campaign targeting:
  * Ministries of foreign affairs across Europe
  * Washington, D.C. embassy of a European Union country
  * High-value diplomatic targets and government entities

APT29 leverages T1001.002 (Steganography) because it allows them to:
* Hide command and control traffic within legitimate-looking files
* Evade network monitoring and detection systems
* Exfiltrate data without triggering security alerts
* Maintain covert communications over extended periods

## Atomic Test Analysis

### Atomic Test #1 - Steganographic Tarball Embedding
**Technique:** File Embedding via Steganography  
**Adversary Usage:** APT29 (Operation Ghost)  
**Command:**
```powershell
Get-Content "image.jpg", "hidden_data.tarz" -Encoding byte -ReadCount 0 | Set-Content "modified_image.jpg" -Encoding byte
```
**Explanation:** APT29 used steganography to hide tar archive files within images during Operation Ghost. This technique allows them to embed compressed data (including credentials, documents, and tools) within seemingly innocent image files, making detection extremely difficult without specialized analysis.

**APT29 Correlation:** Directly used in Operation Ghost for covert data transfer and C2 communications.

### Atomic Test #2 - Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage
**Technique:** Script Execution via Image Steganography  
**Adversary Usage:** APT29 (Operation Ghost)  
**Command:**
```powershell
Import-Module Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1
$extractedScript=Extract-Invoke-PSImage -Image "evil_image.jpg" -Out "result.ps1"
```
**Explanation:** APT29 employed advanced steganographic techniques to hide PowerShell scripts within image pixels. This method allows them to execute malicious code while evading traditional security controls that focus on file content rather than pixel data manipulation.

**APT29 Correlation:** Similar to techniques used for deploying custom malware families like MiniDuke and FatDuke.

### Atomic Test #3 - Execute Embedded Script in Image via Steganography
**Technique:** Linux-based Steganographic Execution  
**Adversary Usage:** APT29 (Cross-platform operations)  
**Command:**
```sh
cat script.sh | base64 | xxd -p | sed 's/../& /g' | xargs -n1 | xxd -r -p | cat image.jpg - > evil_image.jpg
```
**Explanation:** APT29 uses multi-platform steganography techniques. This Linux variant demonstrates their capability to operate across different operating systems while maintaining consistent tradecraft for covert communications.

**APT29 Correlation:** Part of their comprehensive approach to operational security across diverse environments.

## Correlation with APT29 Tradecraft

### Operation Ghost Characteristics:
* **Long-term Campaign**: 6-year duration (2013-2019)
* **Advanced Steganography**: Hidden communications in image files
* **Unique C2 Infrastructure**: Separate infrastructure per victim
* **Social Media Integration**: Twitter accounts for C2 nodes
* **Custom Malware**: MiniDuke, FatDuke, PolyglotDuke families

### Technical Implementation:
* **Image-based Steganography**: Hiding data in BMP, JPEG, PNG files
* **Base64 Encoding**: Additional layer of obfuscation
* **Custom Tools**: Specialized software for embedding/extraction
* **Multi-stage Payloads**: Complex malware deployment chains

### Tactical Objectives:
1. **Covert Communications**: Hidden C2 channels avoiding detection
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Stealthy transfer of stolen information
3. **Defense Evasion**: Bypassing security controls and monitoring
4. **Persistence**: Maintaining long-term access to compromised systems

## Defender Notes

* These tests are high-value because they **closely emulate APT29's advanced tradecraft** from Operation Ghost
* Detection should focus on:
  * Unusual image file transfers (especially to/from unexpected locations)
  * Image files with abnormal file sizes or metadata
  * Processes accessing and modifying image files unexpectedly
  * Network traffic containing image files at unusual times or volumes

* Critical detection opportunities:
  **File analysis**: Image files with embedded data patterns
  **Network monitoring**: Unusual image transfer patterns
  **Process behavior**: Applications manipulating image files
  **Memory analysis**: Processes loading image data into memory

### Mitigation Strategies:
* Implement advanced file content inspection capabilities
* Use steganography detection tools for critical assets
* Monitor for unusual image file processing activities
* Implement data loss prevention (DLP) for sensitive information
* Conduct regular security awareness training about steganography risks

## Detection Recommendations

* **File Analysis**: Implement steganography detection in file scanning
* **Network Monitoring**: Detect unusual image file transfer patterns
* **Endpoint Detection**: Monitor for image file manipulation activities
* **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify processes accessing image files suspiciously
* **Threat Intelligence**: Correlate with known APT29 infrastructure and tools

This test provides defenders with critical capabilities to detect and respond to steganography techniques used by APT29, which are fundamental to their covert operations and long-term campaign success in targeted environments. The techniques demonstrated here reflect the advanced tradecraft that makes APT29 one of the most sophisticated threat actors operating today.
